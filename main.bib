  abstract = {We present a dependently typed assembly language (DTAL) in which the type system supports the use of a restricted form of dependent types, reaping some benefits of dependent types at the assembly level. DTAL improves upon TAL , enabling certain important compiler optimizations such as run-time array bound check elimination and tag check elimination. Also, DTAL formally addresses the issue of representing sum types at assembly level, making it suitable for handling not only datatypes in ML but also dependent datatypes in Dependent ML (DML).},
